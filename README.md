# Home Security System Project

## Project Objectives
- Learn how to program the digital I/O ports using the C programming language.
- Learn how to reference specific pins in the code and identify them on the board.
- Implement a home security system that requires I/O to operate.
- Develop system specifications as a team.
- Practice pair programming.
